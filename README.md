# linters-config

## How to use this repo??ü§î

Each directory listed below contains config files specific to one programming language and README file with detailed instructions:

- [html](./html_validator) (validator not linter)
- [css](./css)
- [ruby](./ruby)
- [ror](./ror)
- [javascript](./javascript)
- [react&redux](./react-redux)

Follow those instructions in order to set up linters or validators in your repo.

In order to get to know more about linters and Stickler read the recap below.


## Linters

A linter is a tool that analyzes your source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs(source: [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)>)).

There are a few reasons for using linters:

1. Catching syntax errors is more efficient. There is no need to debug simple mistakes like typos - the linter does it for you.
2. The entire codebase looks like written by one person.
3. Programmers can focus on solving problems, instead of cleaning up the code.

---

You can find linters for most of the programming languages, e.g. Rubocop for Ruby or ESLint for JavaScript.

Also, there are many ways you can integrate a linter in your workflow:

- text editor plugin
- git hook
- Github app.

## Stickler

Stickler is an app, that can be integrated into any Github repo. It uses multiple linters that can be configured according to the programmer‚Äôs needs.
